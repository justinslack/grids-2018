    <p>You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Everything's not great in life, but we can still findbeauty in it. You gotta think like a tree. This is truly an almighty mountain. Just let this happen. We just letthis flow right out of our minds.</p>
    <p> You are only limited by your imagination. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Anyone can paint.</p>
    <p>It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. If you don't like it - change it. It's yourworld. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share itwith a friend.</p>
